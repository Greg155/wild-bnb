### Challenge 1  
Create a React App, split every part of the website as small react components. Please use and discover the library Styled Components (https://styled-components.com/) to create your Components. At this stage, you should be able to import each CSS class from the original repo, one by one, in your components.

### Challenge 2 
Train yourself displaying a list of renting the React way, within a state, using a .map() in the JSX. 
FYI, it is possible to call a local JSON file ( a JSON file saved directly in your project) with Axios and fetch, the same way you would call a web API. So you need to create a JSON file of renting, and load it like you would call an API with react.

### Challenge 3
Recreate the filter bar with react.
It should update the state accordingly.
It is a training on manipulating state to refresh a list, manage controlled input and events in React
